      bio: "As a Chinese Teochew born and raised in France, I created Bitcoin Hong Bao to bridge traditional gift-giving with modern technology. Growing up with the red envelope tradition, I wanted to share the beauty of combining our cultural heritage with Bitcoin's innovation, making it easier for friends and family to preserve and share wealth across generations."

          a: "Originally inspired by Chinese tradition of gifting red envelopes, Hong₿ao is a simple way to preserve and share wealth across generations using Bitcoin.<br/>It now combines AI to let you print beautifully personalized Bitcoin paper gifts for your loved ones."
        how_works:
          q: "How does it work?"
          a: "Select one or more styles, upload your photo and generate your custom bank note. Then you can print and top up the note with Bitcoin through our secure partner Mt Pelerin or directly from your wallet."
        security:
          q: "Is this actually safe?"
          a: "Yep! Your Bitcoin wallet is generated right in your browser — your private key never leaves your device.<br/>Want extra peace of mind? Just switch off your internet after picking your design and you’re good to go.<br/>You won’t be able to use Mt Pelerin to top it up while offline, but you can still send Bitcoin to it from any wallet.<br/>And don’t just take our word for it — the code is <a href='https://github.com/sbounmy/hongbao_bitcoin' class='underline' target='_blank' rel='noopener'>open source</a>, so anyone can inspect it."
        why:
          q: "Can’t I just send Bitcoin to their wallet?"
          a: "If you ask for their wallet address, it’s kind of like saying, 'Hey, I’m giving you Bitcoin!' — and where’s the fun in that? Hong₿ao lets you keep the mystery and make it feel like a real gift."
