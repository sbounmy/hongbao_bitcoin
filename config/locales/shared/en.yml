      bio: "As a Chinese Teochew born and raised in France, I created Bitcoin Hong Bao to bridge traditional gift-giving with modern technology. Growing up with the red envelope tradition, I wanted to share the beauty of combining our cultural heritage with Bitcoin's innovation, making it easier for friends and family to preserve and share wealth across generations."
