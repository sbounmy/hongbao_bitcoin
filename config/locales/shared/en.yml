      bio: "As a Chinese Teochew born and raised in France, I created Bitcoin Hong Bao to bridge traditional gift-giving with modern technology. Growing up with the red envelope tradition, I wanted to share the beauty of combining our cultural heritage with Bitcoin's innovation, making it easier for friends and family to preserve and share wealth across generations."

        Bitcoin sofware is free. HongBao is open source and free to use.
        The best way to educate people about Bitcoin is to make it easy to use for everyone.
