### Email Testing

In development, emails are caught by Letter Opener and displayed in your browser instead of being sent. This makes it easy to preview and debug email templates.

You can view sent emails in two ways:

1. **Automatic Preview**: When an email is sent (e.g., magic link), it automatically opens in a new browser tab

2. **Email Dashboard**: Visit http://localhost:3000/letter_opener to see all emails sent during your development session

Example of testing the magic link flow:
1. Click "Sign in" and enter your email
2. A new tab will open showing the email with the magic link
3. Click the link to complete the authentication

Note: This only works in development environment. In production, real emails will be sent.

### Adding JavaScript Dependencies

We use ImportMaps with [JSPM](https://jspm.io/). To add new JavaScript dependencies:

-1. Visit [JSPM Generator](https://generator.jspm.io/)
2. Search and select your package
3. Copy the generated import URL from the right panel as shown below:

4. Add the URL to your `config/importmap.rb`:

```ruby
pin "jspdf", to: "https://ga.jspm.io/npm:jspdf@2.5.2/dist/jspdf.es.min.js"
